# Go Structures!
Just GoLang Data Structures (with generics to handle all data types).

Nothing more, nothing less.

Find "API Documentation" in headers for now. Please wait while I finish more structures for proper documentation.

## Completed Structures:
1. Binary Search Tree
2. Linked Lists (Single/Double)
3. Stacks
4. Queues (non-priority)
5. Circular Lists

## Planned Structures:
1. Graphs
2. Vectors (?)
3. Balance Trees (?)
4. Heaps (Min and Max)
