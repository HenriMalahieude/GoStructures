# Go Structures!
Just GoLang Data Structures (with generics to handle all data types).

Nothing more, nothing less.

Find "API Documentation" in headers for now. Please wait while I finish more structures for proper documentation.

## Completed Structures:
1. Binary Search Tree
2. Linked Lists (Single/Double)

## Planned Structures:
1. Stacks
2. Queues (Normal + Priority)
3. Graphs
4. Circular Lists
5. Vectors (?)
6. Balance Trees (?)
7. Heaps (Min and Max)
